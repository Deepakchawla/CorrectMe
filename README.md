# CorrectMe
This Project contains two API one is auto-corrections and autosuggestions.
Auto-correction build with the help of text blob library and other one is auto-suggestions with the help of transforms and Bart large model.

## Project Intro

The purpose of this project is to train the next word predicting models. Models should be able to suggest the next word after the user has input word/words auto-correct the incorrect word/s like Gmail and Grammarly doing.
Autocorrect the incorrect word in the input field.

## Project Description
* `app.py` - In that file three APIs are there, one is auto_correction and the second one is auto_suggestion and the last one is index file rendering file.
* `main.py` - use pre-trained Bart model for next word prediction
